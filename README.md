### Notes:
- `[nickname]` - required argument.
- `(page)` - list page number; defaults to 1 if not specified.
- `(time)` - the duration for which the player will be whitelisted.  
  Example: `2d 3h 10m`.  
  Leave empty to whitelist permanently.

## Placeholders
All output messages can be customized in the configuration.

- `%wlbytime_in_whitelist%` - Indicates if a player is in the whitelist.
- `%wlbytime_time_left%` - Time remaining in the whitelist.

## FAQ
1. **Why is the plugin file size large?**  
   It includes libraries such as ORMLite (database), Caffeine (cache), bStats (metrics), and Elytrium-Serializer (config handling).

2. **I have an issue or a suggestion. Where should I report it?**  
   Open an issue in this repository with a detailed description. Any feedback is welcome!

3. **Will there be support for BungeeCord/Velocity?**  
   No, the plugin is being developed exclusively for Paper and Folia.
